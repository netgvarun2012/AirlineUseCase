All the questions are listed in assessment.md so your first task will be reading and editing a markdown file.
Write down your answers in `assessment.md` in italic formatting and blue color (any blue) 
except for codes which need to be written in .ipynb/.sql.

If you encounter any problems or enquiries on the question set, you can always reach out to superappds@airasia.com on working hours or the recruiters who reach out to you.
